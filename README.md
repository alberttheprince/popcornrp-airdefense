A simple air defense resource to shoot at helicopters and airplanes flying near the prison or military base.

**Dependencies:**

- QBox or QBCore for job exceptions and notifications. Can be removed to make standalone!

This resource is provided as is. No support or issue fixes will be provided. Comments have been left in the client.lua for things you can edit. I am not an experienced programmer or dev, I made this simply as a fun resource for my community, and it may need to be better coded. 

If you're not happy with something in it, change it yourself.

If you need help changing it after reading the comments, then no soup for you.

Thank you to Sqrl for helping me with this and teaching me about Lua coding. Please check out his far better resource:

Thank you to Brian (briantu) on the CFX discord for providing a simple foundation for this resource while I explored what the AirDefense natives were (I still have no idea what they do).

Thank you to Jorn and Stan for explaining the difference between 'and' and 'or'.
